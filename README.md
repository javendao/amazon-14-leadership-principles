# The 14 Principles
## 1. Customer Obsessed
Think about the client first. Go above and beyond to help your customer. Even if that means sending them to the competitor because they have the solution they need.
## 2. Think Big
## 3. Have backbone
Don't be afraid to speak up. Make proposals and complete them.
## 4. Ownership
If you failed, don't blame the system or others. Own your mistake and make sure you learned from them so they don't happen again.
## 5. Be curious
## 6. Frugal
Do more with less. Does not mean use less or be cheap, it means getting the work done with quality but using less resources.
## 7. Be right
Use facts and information to go through your projects.
## 8. Finish on time?
